This application parses two java source files and prints their 
abstract syntax trees in XML format and the changes in the second file 
compared to the first one. 

The ASTs are generated by reading the files with GumTree's java AST 
generator. Then, matches between the trees and actions that turn 
the firs one into second are found. These actions are printed like in 
the ActionIoUtils.toText() serializer but without printing matches.  

To launch, two file paths should be passed as command line parameters.
